# SEO-optimisedpage

A **single-file, SEO-focused landing page** (currently `index.html`) for a creative technologist profile/portfolio. The repo description frames the page around **Kai William Piper (Bournemouth)** and highlights 3D, Unity/Three.js simulations, AI-enabled web tools, and 3D printing workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What this repository is for

This project is meant to be a **fast, indexable, conversion-oriented page** that can be deployed quickly (e.g., GitHub Pages) and tuned for:
- **Search visibility** (clean semantics, metadata, structured data, canonical URL discipline)
- **Performance** (good Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals)
- **Accessibility** (proper headings/landmarks, keyboard support, contrast)
- **Lead capture** (clear CTA, contact links, portfolio links)

The current About text is explicitly positioned as a professional “what I do” statement. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Quick start

### Run locally (recommended)
Even if the page is just static HTML, serving it avoids browser quirks and lets you test headers/caching more realistically.

**Python**
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
